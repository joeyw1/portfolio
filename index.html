        <h3>Project 1 :  Data Visualization, Storytelling & Article Writing Project - Tech Talents Supply in Southeast Asia</h3>
        <h3>Tool used: Power Bi</h3>

        <p>The dataset was obtained by extracting the details of Linkedln users between the months of May and July 2021. The goal of this project is to identify which Southeast Asian countries have the highest supply of tech talents and which job roles are in severe shortage, as well as to offer solutions.</p>
        <p>A lot of research work was done to support in the writing of the article.</p>

        <p>The goal of this project is to determine how the terrorism trend has changed over time and the number of people who have died because of these attacks.</p>
        <p>The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. This dataset is messy, and some data cleaning techniques, such as dealing with missing values, outliers, and so on, have to be used in this project.</p>
        <p>Two interactive dashboards have been created, and some visualization techniques such as appropriate charts, colors, and tooltips, are needed in this project.</p>

        <h3>Project 3 :  Data Storytelling Project - Credit Card Customer Churn</h3>
        <h3>Tool used: Tableau</h3>
        <p>The project's goal is to identify potential credit card churners, contact them before they cancel their accounts, and present the findings to key management during the meeting.</p>
        <p>To make it easier for key management to remember the information, I used the Freytag pyramid narrative model to tell a story about the data. It outlined the following concepts: introduction (exposition), rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. After the setting of the scene, the audience is led to the main insight (climax), which is followed by a recommendation or resolution.</p>

        <h3>Project 4 : Machine Learning Project - Chicago Crime Prediction </h3>
        <h3>Tool used: Datarobot</h3> <h3>Accuracy: 77.6%</h3>
        <p>Goal: train and predict where the violent crimes are more likely to occur.</p>
        <p>Using a predictive model to predict which areas/locations, such as an apartment or a street, and what type of crime will occur. Police could be warned in this way, and they could then increase their surveillance and patrolling around that area.</p>
